# AIMi

Free and open source AI Aimbot that works with any game.
Stability depends on the game, for example CS2 and CS 1.6, in CS2 the aimbot is shaky and unstable (But still works pretty well) while CS 1.6 is seamless and stable.

## Customization:

- If you're not sure what the settings mean, you'll be better off by leaving it just how it is, it's very easy to make the aimbot worse and more obvious to whoever is watching you play.
- If you still want to try messing with the settings, just go to lib/detect.py and open it with a text editor of your choice. The code contains a few comments to make the customization a little bit easier.

## Features:

- Two modes controlled by F1:
- Always on/Hold mode
- Aimbot in hold mode works only when mouse4 is pressed.
- 100% safe as it isn't injected into the game in any way, meaning that the anticheat won't detect it.
- More features.

## Requirements:

- Newest version of Python

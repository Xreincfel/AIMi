# AIMi

Free and open source AI Aimbot that works with any game.
Stability depends on the game, for example CS2 and CS 1.6, in CS2 the aimbot is shaky and unstable (But still works pretty well) while CS 1.6 is seamless and stable.

## Features:

- Two modes controlled by F1:
- Always on/Hold mode
- Aimbot in hold mode works only when mouse4 is pressed.
- 100% safe as it isn't injected into the game in any way, meaning that the anticheat won't detect it.
- More features.

## Requirements:

- Newest version of Python
